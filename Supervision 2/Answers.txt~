-------------Question 2

a) Modularity
	A few of behaviours are associated with a few abstract concepts, e.g. abstract classes. 
AN employee is too vague a concept for anyone to be just an employee. Tus as in the firs example
it is possible to split the properties and methods of all employed people away from their current 
description. This allows you to change and inter-change the code pertinent to all employees without
even caring how many kinds of employeess are there. 
	For example at first we wanted to distribute salary in cash: assign a day, another person
with the job title - cashier, to give it away in person, form queues and deliver lots of inconvenience
to everyone. Then we realised this is wasteful, so we've done away with the need for a cashier, 
and changed the method of getting paid, for example to a bank transfer, we could do that just in 
one place: the definition of the employee class. Thus all classes that inherit from it, would 
also inherit the changes. 
	Additionally thanks to dynamic polymorphism this means that we could have a pay method that
needs not be overloaded to take every single kind of employee separately. 

b) In the second example, implementation of the abstract classes MotorDriven and HumanPowered allows
us to implement partiually, and in two diverse ways how a vehicle can be driven (e.g. it could be a 
motor that powers the wheeels, or it could be also a human. THus the subclasses need not contain 
duplicate code taht explains how for example an internal combustion engine works, they'll just inherit 
that code

c) Encapsulation in the first example is the fact taht there are no items lying around that the clientelle 
can pick up withot paying for. THis increases the programmers ability to control what's going on. A 
programmer can limit ways in which certain objects can be interacted with by encapsulating them inside 
other objects whose methods allow interaction. THis allows the programmer to rule out a few potential 
exceptions and not worry about them in the future. In the second example a programmer can be sure at any
point in time that a car can only have 3 or 4 wheels, because encapsulation allows for objects of class 
car be both immutable and useful. 

-------------Question 3
	A class is a grouping (or encapsulation) of an idea, it's properties and behaviours. Ususally a
 class should contain the Definitions of all member functions e.g. methods. Additionally it could have 
member values which can and should be initialised either by default or inside a constructor (ideally both).
	An abstract class describes some concept taht isn't independent on its own. An employee has a 
speciality there are no general employees, they all do something, which is in everyone's case different. 
In the below example an animal is an abstract class. It describes an animal as something that has age, 
legs and a name. All animals have different amounts of legs, age and names. All of them live, bue all live
differently. All subclasses need to define what it is to live, otherwise a general animal can't be created
because it doesn't know how to live. 
	An Interface also allows for programmers to allow different ideas that behave the same way to be 
unified. For example: a pet may be different it may not even always be a mammal. THat's why we just state
what beahiour should a pet implement and leave the programmers free to do it. 

	Below code examples are given (also in Git Repository).

----------Question 4

Polymorphism is the ability to resolve function calls of different object containing implementations of the 
same virtual or abstract method. e.g. if we have a class catadded to the above example, we could have 
different implementations of the pet method. Have a list of pets and pet each and every one of them. 

IF we have two separate data structures, for example arrays to hold all the cats and all the dogs separately,
we could do static polymorphism, e.g. typecast all cats into the cat array, all dogs into the dog array
and it's known what kind of method will be called each time at compilation time. 

Dynamic polymorphism allows you to cram different implementations of animals into a single datastrcuture of 
type pet and iterate through it to call pet. Each time the result will be different. WHere the pet is a dog, 
it will make puppy eyes, where a pet is a cat, it will try to put your eyes out or make purrring noise.

Dynamic polymorphism unbinds the coders hands and allows for the program to behave according to the situation
without necessarily knowing what's going to happen beforehand. We may want for the user to specify what
kinds of pets he wants to put into our datastructure, and in what order. We might also like for other 
programmers to be able to implement other types of animals externally without us having to change our 
code several times. This saves lots of checking, which makes code much more legible to the viewer. 


--------QUestion 5

--------QUestion 6

As opposed to C++ and its sane, albeit dangerous solution of allowing the programmer to specify
where and when do they want to free up memory, java is fitted with a garbage collection utility. 

WHat it does is it periodically sweeps the heap by either reference counting or tracing or other more 
sophisticated methods periodically removes objects on the heap that aren't any more referenced by any 
call in the stack. 

Sometimes removing an object may be straightforward, e.g. just freeing up memory will revert the machine
to its initial state without doing any damage. However, if the obhject in turn interacts with the system 
itself, there's sometimes need for final touchups before the object is removed from memory. 

C++ had destructors which were called when the object was deleted. However, since pointers in c/C++ could
be arbitratily assigned this caused trouble with potential damage to the system objects. Additionally,
sometimes the programmer might forget to delete the object, thus the destructor is never called. 

Finaliser's are Oracles take on the problem. They're called when the java grabage collector is about to 
delete the object. They aren't called destructors on purpose, because they cannot be invoked at will, and 
there's absolutely no telling when if ever the garbage collector will call it. 

--------Question 7

public void testOutput(){
	Person p = new Person ("Joe", "Bloggs");
	System.out.prinltn("PErson DEtails:" + p);
}

The above function contains implicit typecasting. All classes in Java extend the Object class. An Object
defines cloning and comparing, as well as conversion to String, If in class Person we have overridden 
the Object's method toString then the above call can be arbitrarily interchanged. 

FOr example this will output 
	"PErson DEtails: BLoggs, John"
@Override 
public String toString (){
	return Surname + ", "+ name;
}

or this  
	"PErson DEtails: Johny Bloggsy"
@Override 
public String toString (){
	return name+"y, "+ surname+"y";
}
